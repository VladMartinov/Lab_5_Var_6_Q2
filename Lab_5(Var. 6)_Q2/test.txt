We are waiting for the harvest from the best vines,
So that beauty lives without fading.
Let the petals of ripe roses wither,
The young rose keeps their memory.

And you, in love with your beauty,
All the best giving her juices,
Abundance turns into poverty -
Your worst enemy, soulless and cruel.

You are the beauty of today
Herald of short-lived spring, -
Burying the future in its infancy,
You combine stinginess with waste.

Pitying the world, do not betray the earth
A great harvest for the coming years!

When your forehead is furrowed
Deep traces of forty winters,
Who will remember the regal attire,
Disdainful of your miserable rags?

And to the question: “Where are they hiding now
Remnants of the beauty of merry years? —
What do you say? At the bottom of dead eyes?
But your answer will be an evil mockery.

The words would sound better:
“Look at my children.
My former freshness is alive in them,
They are the justification for my old age.”

Let the blood run cold over the years
In your heir it burns again!


You see a beautiful face in the mirror
And if you do not hurry to repeat
You will offend your features, nature,
Deprive a woman of blessings.

What mortal wouldn't be glad
Give you untouched new?
Or you don't need immortality, -
How big is your love for yourself?

For mother's eyes you are a reflection
Long gone April days.
And you will find comfort under old age
In the same windows of your youth.

But, limiting life to their fate,
You yourself will die, and your image is with you.

Sweet squanderer, you squander
His legacy in an extravagant rampage.
Nature does not give us beauty,
But he gives in debt - free to free.

Pretty curmudgeon, you're happy to assign
That which is given to you for transmission.
Uncounted you hide the treasure,
It doesn't make you richer.

You make deals with yourself
Depriving yourself of the profits of the rich.
And in the terrible hour appointed by fate,
What account will you give in your embezzlement?

With you the image of the future,
Unincarnated, will be buried.

Sneak time with fine craftsmanship
A magical holiday poses for the eyes.
And the same time in a circular run
It takes away everything that makes us happy.

Hours and days unrestrained flow
Leads the summer into the twilight of winter days,
Where there is no foliage, the juice froze in the trees,
The earth is dead and a white cloak is on it.

And only the aroma of blooming roses -
Flying prisoner, locked in glass -
Reminds me of cold and frost
That summer was on earth.

The flowers have lost their former brilliance,
But they kept the soul of beauty.

See that a hard hand
Gray winter in the garden did not visit,
Until you pick the flowers, until
You can't pour spring into crystal phial.

Like a man, what a precious contribution
With more than abundant received back,
You will be glad to get yourself back
With a legitimate profit tenfold.

You will live ten times in the world
Repeated ten times in children,
And you will have the right in your last hour
Triumph over conquered death.

You are too generously endowed with fate,
May perfection die with you.

Burning head dawn
Raises from his bed,
And all earthly things send him greetings,
Radiant meeting the deity.

When in the prime of life, at noon,
The luminary looks from a steep height, -
With what delight millions of eyes
Follow the golden chariot!

When the sun completes the circle
And rolls wearily into the sunset,
The eyes of his worshipers and servants
Already looking the other way.

Leave your son, burying youth.
He will meet the sun of tomorrow!

You are music, but musical sounds
You listen with incomprehensible longing.
Why do you love what is so sad
Do you meet flour with such joy?

Where is the secret reason for this torment?
Is it because you are saddened
What harmoniously coordinated sounds
Sound like a reproach to loneliness?

Listen how friendly the strings are
They join the ranks and give a voice, -
As if mother, father and young boy
They sing in happy unity.

We are told by the accord of strings in a concert,
That the lonely way is like death.

Must be afraid of widow's tears,
You have not tied yourself to anyone with love.
But if a formidable fate took you away,
The whole world would put on a widow's veil.

In her child, a mournful widow
Favorite features are reflected.
And you do not leave the creature,
In which the light would find consolation.

Wealth that wastes
Changing place, remains in the world.
And beauty will vanish without a trace
And youth, having disappeared, will not return.

Who betrays himself
Doesn't love anyone in this world!

In conscience, tell me: who do you love?
You know, many people love you.
But you are ruining youth so carelessly,
What is clear to everyone - you live without loving.

His fierce enemy, not knowing regret,
You destroy secretly day after day
Gorgeous, waiting to be updated,
Your inherited house.

Change - and I will forgive the offense,
In the soul love, not enmity warm.
Be as gentle as you look beautiful
And be kind and generous to yourself.

Let beauty live not only now,
But he will repeat himself in his beloved son.

We wither quickly, just as we grow.
We grow in descendants, in a new crop.
Excess strength in your heir
Consider it yours, cooling down over the years.

This is the law of wisdom and beauty.
And without him they would reign in the world
Madness, old age until the end of time
And the world would disappear in six decades.

Let the one who is not sweet to life and earth, -
Faceless, rude, - perishes irretrievably.
And you received such gifts,
That you can return them many times.

You are carved skillfully, like a seal,
To convey its imprint to the centuries.
